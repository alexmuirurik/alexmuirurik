Cloud computing is surging in popularity as a lower-cost alternative to on-premises technology, and cloud storage is now virtually on every smartphone device. But what's the difference between the two, you wonder? 

This article demystifies the differences between cloud storage and cloud computing to help you understand the best option for you.

## What's Cloud Storage?

Cloud storage is a platform that allows you to store data on the internet and access it remotely. You rent storage space from vendors who manage the capacity, security, and durability of the required hardware. It eliminates the need for buying and managing your data storage infrastructure, like hard drives and home servers. 

### Why Would You Need Cloud Storage? 

You may need cloud storage for many reasons, including: 

- To back up and recover critical data, such that it's protected and accessible from anywhere when you need it. 
- To collect and transfer large amounts of data to the cloud, where your applications and the Internet of Things analyze and share the data.
- To host big data databases for your local or cloud applications.

## What's Cloud Computing? 

Cloud computing is when you rent an IT infrastructure over the internet rather than purchasing and installing on-premises servers. Unlike cloud storage, cloud computing is an on-demand system, where you only pay for what you use. 

In cloud computing, the service provider handles additional tasks such as integrating essential applications, adapting security measures, and maintaining components. They also provide you with the resources you need to run your applications.  

There are three types of cloud computing: Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS). 

- SaaS is accessing a software application over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis, for example, using Office 360. 
- IaaS is getting everything from servers to operating systems as an on-demand service. Popular IaaS systems include IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and more.
- PaaS is a platform where you can create software via the internet. Great examples include Heroku and Salesforce.

### Why Would You Need Cloud Computing?

In 2021, 41% of EU companies veered to cloud computing. Key reasons for the shift included lower operational costs, better collaboration with workers, and increased flexibility. 

Other key factors you should consider include: 

- **Quick app deployment.** Cloud computing allows developers to test new ideas in seconds without hardware limitations and slow procurement processes. 
- **Automatic system upgrades and integration.** Unlike traditional software, which takes hours to update, cloud apps update in seconds. Product developers can also monitor and detect issues, resolving them immediately.
- **Reducing costs.** Businesses don't need to purchase on-premises infrastructure to launch businesses. With just a laptop, you could build the most sophisticated system on the internet.
- **Data Security.** Natural disasters, hacking, and accidents can cause massive losses. Cloud computing secures your data, allowing you to relocate and continue with your work undisturbed. 
- **Scalability.** If business demands increase, you can simply upgrade to higher capacity and server speeds. Upgrading is cheaper and takes less time compared to in-house infrastructures.

## Upgrade Your Business IT Infrastructure Today

With your software and data stored in a remote location, your greatest concern is the credibility of a service provider and the security of your digital assets. Google Cloud is a leading provider of cloud computing services and IT solutions.

With the platform, you don't have to worry about lags, security issues, or losing data. We back up data on multiple servers across the US, meaning that even if one went down, you'd never notice.
