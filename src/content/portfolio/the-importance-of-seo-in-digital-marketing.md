Here are the key benefits of SEO in digital marketing: 

### 1. Increased Visibility

Search engine visibility is the percentage of traffic your website receives from organic searches. Visibility relies on the position of your website on SERPs. Users often interact with the top 10 websites on the first SERP. 

So, ranking higher can help increase your website's visibility and the potential to get clicks and visitors. SEO helps you rank higher for relevant keywords. By producing evergreen content and optimising keywords, you can ensure higher search engine rankings. 

### 2. Credibility and Trust

From a reader's perspective, the higher your website ranks on search engines, the more likely it provides the relevant information they seek. They trust that search engines will choose the best results for their search queries. 

Users will choose among the first 10 results because they view them as credible sources. If you rank first on SERPs, they believe it's the most relevant for their search. Your site will appear more credible and trustworthy to your readers. 

### 3. Gaining Targeted Traffic

According to Fundera, 61% of marketers say their biggest challenge is getting more target traffic and leads, but you can't get traffic without content and SEO. SEO has the potential to generate up to 300% more traffic than the average social media campaign. 

You tap into an interested audience by optimising keywords they already search for. Since most traffic from search engines is searching for products like yours, you get more qualified traffic than other marketing strategies. 

### 4. Cost-Effective Marketing 

SEO costs 61% less than outbound marketing strategies. It targets an audience that's actively looking for specific products. 
To increase conversion rates, you must answer all the basic questions. These include: 

- What does your product offer? 
- Where is it based? 
- How can a user buy the product from you?
- Whatss the method of payment? 
- Are there shipping fees applicable? 

With the right background and research, you can reach these customers, and if your website is trustworthy, they'll buy from you.

### 5. Long-term growth

SEO is key to long-term business growth. It may take time and effort to rank on the first SERP, but you can attract many customers with one keyword phrase. The higher your website ranks on SERPs for high-volume and relevant keywords, the more quality traffic you attract. 

You must constantly update your website content with high-quality, valuable content your readers are more likely to respond to. The higher the response and the lower the bounce rate, the higher your website ranks on SERPs.

### 3. Optimize your website structure.
