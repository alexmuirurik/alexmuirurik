A server operating system (OS) provides the foundation for hosting applications and services on the internet. That's why it's crucial to any data center or network. It's also designed to provide communication services to devices and computers. 

With numerous options available in the market, it can be tough to pick a superb server OS. Read on to learn why CentOS 7 is the best for your dedicated bare-metal server.

## Popular Server Operating Systems 

There are three widely popular server operating systems today:

### 1. Linux Servers

Linux servers date back to the 90s. Many coding experts and developers consider it to be one of the best server OS options. Other than supporting server functionalities for small computers, Linux offers the following popular benefits:
 
- Real-time performance
- Multiprocessor support
- Stability
- Capability to support multiple users
- Practical applications, such as a high-level language compiler and a text editor  

### 2. Microsoft Windows Servers

Windows servers started with Windows NT. However, Microsoft Windows OS servers have been operational for a long period. Windows Server 2022 is the brand's latest version. It allows users to set up virtual servers and supports hypervisors; that is a huge advantage.  

The familiar file management system present in the Windows operating systems endeared many people to the Windows Server OS. Other qualities that have made this OS highly popular include 

- Network-wide security management, which results in excellent security 
- Large-capacity memory management 
- Symmetric multiprocessor systems support 


### 3. CentOS 7

The Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS) is another popular server OS based on the renowned Linux distro Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Its framework makes it stable and enables it to sustain enterprise-level server tasks. 

CentOS 7 is a fantastic option for cloud, bare-metal, and dedicated servers. It can run plenty of the software available to RHEL users, and the server performance is admirably consistent. Thanks to its cradle, the OS has a highly customizable platform and is very secure. 


## Reasons Why CentOS 7 Is the Most Popular OS

As a Linux distribution, CentOS has been the preferred web hosting solution for many years. CentOS 7 is also a top contender for running dedicated bare-metal servers. 

Below are the top reasons why the platform is so popular: 

- **Security.** Backed by the Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), CentOS 7 can thwart a wide range of cyberattacks. SELinux, for instance, allows you to access control policies for your most precious files and processes.   
- **Stability.** There is no need to update your CentOS applications now and then since its release cycle is longer, with stable software versions.   
- **Package management.** By relying on the YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified), CentOS is able to keep your system up to date. Consequently, the OS is highly modular, implying that you can remove or add features as you please. 
- **Management panel support.** There are numerous management options available in CentOS, including SpaceWalk, WebMin, cPanel, VestaCP, Virtualmin, CWP, and Plesk. 
- **Regular updates.** Every few years, Red Hat releases a new CentOS Linux version, with each version being supported for ten years. As a result, issues caused by updating the software are fewer.  

Managing your cloud applications and services has never been easier with the wide range of server OS options available today. Whatever option you go for, pair it with a powerful bare-metal dedicated server and make the most out of cloud computing.
