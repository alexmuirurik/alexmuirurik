You must adopt career progression to ensure your career path is adaptable and to keep improving your skills and income. Sometimes you may elevate your ranking in the same company or move to a new company to work in a junior position. 

After figuring out the role you want, you can devise a plan to help progress your career. In this article, we'll elaborate on how career progression works and the right steps to follow. 

## What is career progression?

Career progression is changing jobs to reach the position you desire in your work life. You can progress by getting a promotion, finding new opportunities, new challenges, and alternative employment, or getting the most out of your career. 

Career progression has no limitations, and there are many aspects that contribute to the position changes. You can even progress your career in a different field by getting the necessary skills to become what you desire. 

Some professions have a clear career path, which can help them reach their desired rank or salary expectations. It's worthwhile to understand your industry and clarify your aspirations to make an informed plan for the career path you want. 

## Tips for career progression

Here are helpful tips to guide you as you plan your career progression path: 

### Networking

Networking is one of the most effective ways to progress your career, as you only need to appear in conferences and meetings to connect with people. Start by connecting with people in your company or those closest to your circle. 

Networking can help you share your skills and knowledge with others. If you wish to progress your career to a different profession, knowing people in the industry can also be helpful. 

Top venues to network with experts include conferences, book classes, and business events. While socialising, talk to experts who can help progress your career, and try to help others as well. Someone may notice your potential and assist you or invite you for an interview. 

### Make a career plan

Having a career plan outlines your path from where you are to where you wish to be. A plan can keep you focused as you march on to your next career step. It makes it easy to identify your goals based on how you wish to shape your career. 

After identifying the position that you desire, find out where you are in relation to that. A plan will make it easy for you to monitor and gauge your progress and find out if your career path is progressive. 

### Use your appraisals

Take both positive and negative criticism as a wonderful gesture towards developing your career. Critics can help you become better by pointing out areas you may need to improve to increase your performance. 

Compliments give you the motivation to do more challenging work. Therefore, when you get appraisals, use them as a stepping stone to elevate to the next step in your career. Appraisals also help you track your progress in your career and give you an opportunity to set and develop your goals. 

When your employer gives you an appraisal and you were hoping for a promotion, leverage this opportunity to enquire about your earnings and make brilliant points to impress your superiors. 

### Stay motivated to exceed your goals

If you get to a position that earns you more money, don't stop pursuing your career progression goals. And if your current company doesn't support progression in your preferred direction, it could be best if you move on. 

Your dreams aren't limited to your current employment. Instead, it would be best if you focused on improving your skills by finding new opportunities. Working in a company with no clear progress plan for its employees makes it tough for you to ascend. 

### Know your industry

Rapid and daily influxes of new technology are affecting all industries. Therefore, you must adopt a growth mentality to progress your career. Otherwise, you'll be overtaken by the new generation with better tech. Use technology to equip yourself and be ready for changes that may improve your performance. 

When the company adopts new technology, be among the first to figure out how you can use it to affect your operations. Ensure you stay updated with news and journals about your field. Learning new things and equipping yourself with solid information positions you better for progression. 

## Conclusion 

Career progression is a healthy move to keep yourself relevant and growing in your profession. You don't need to work in the top companies to progress; you can start slow in your current organisation or position. 

Start by learning new technologies, connecting with peers and other experts, and creating a solid career progression plan. These tips can help you advance with time and grow.
