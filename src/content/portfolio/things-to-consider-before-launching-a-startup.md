Thousands of startups have sprouted in recent decades to follow the trailblazing path of Facebook, Twitter, and others in the commercial business arena. They may have big ideas, plans, and dreams, but only a few can navigate hurdles on the path to success, which is extremely rugged. 

Getting your company up and running is easy, but building a lasting business can be challenging. [FreshBooks deduced](https://www.freshbooks.com/hub/startup/what-percentage-of-businesses-fail-first-year) that business failure rates typically increase with years of operation, and nine out of ten startups will fail. If you are looking to build a sustainable business model, here are things to consider.

## Raising Funding for Your Startup

From the minute your business shoots, you'll need sufficient funds. [Fortune says](http://fortune.com/2014/09/25/why-startups-fail-according-to-their-founders/) that the lack of capital is a key reason why startups fail. You may have enough money to start but lose it later due to accounting, product pricing, or marketing problems. You must monitor your record books regularly to see the business' progress. 

In addition, seek lenders and investors to avoid failing. Most startups rely on a single client who typically makes the most purchases. When the client disappears, they take the company's funding with them. Therefore, it's wise to seek investors and loans from banks and alternative lenders to stabilize your cash flow. 

## Learning About the Process Involved

To build a sustainable business model, you need a solid business plan. [Michael Dell](https://www.inc.com/murray-newlands/25-inspirational-startup-quotes.html), chairman and CEO of Dell, said that ideas are a commodity, but the execution process cannot be bought or sold. Even if you have great ideas, you'll fail if you lack a proper execution plan. 

A solid business plan can also help you qualify for loans and investment capital from investors. After learning how to make a good business plan, get informed on the risks involved. 

The startup economy is full of potential, but it's riddled with deadly risks. If you are looking to dive into the intimidating deep-end startup pool, you'll need to assess the financial, team experience, political, and economic risks. 

Lastly, consult legal and financial advisors to help you manage finances. Legal advisors will help you register your business name and file your taxes, while financial advisors guide you on the number of employees to hire and the right budget for your business expenditure.

## Hiring and Motivating Your Team of Workers

Get a team of co-founders and advisors you can manage and make deals diligently. It's wise to hire the best team to augment your ideas and build the product that you desire. You'll also need to delegate tasks to a team of professionals. 

Most startups lack the capital to hire experts to build their brand. You'll need to invest in experts who are capable of helping you accomplish your product's potential to stand out. You can also invest in your talent by training, guidance, and motivation to increase their royalty. 

## Assessing the Product's Potential 

Assessing product potential is a huge challenge for many startups. Even though it may be your dream career, or you've invested millions of dollars in development, if the product is not marketable, then it's not a dream worth pursuing.

You can garner adequate funding if you can explain what your product does, the problem it solves, and why investors should invest. However, your product must address a significant market to make a profit and grow. 

Remember, many [startups waste millions](https://www.inc.com/sean-wise/5-lessons-from-startup-graveyard-2018-what-losing-14b-in-vc-funding-can-teach.html) before realizing that their products were overvalued or have a significant competitor. You should, therefore, be keen on your investors' and customers' needs to avoid a business shutdown. 

## Developing a Marketing Plan

Marketing is one of the most crucial elements of a startup. To make sales and grow, your products must appeal to both the customers and investors. You'll need a resilient and persuasive marketing team to sell your product's features and benefits. 

First, understand the trends and markets within your industry. Today, most people are no longer interested in business-oriented products but in tools that can make their work easier. Understand what your audience wants and feed that to them. 

For instance, [Dropbox and Evernote marketers](https://medium.com/@christianreber/15-steps-to-launch-your-own-startup-74e945869ca4) tried to sell project management, and their customers never showed interest. Everyone paid attention when they changed their story to the tools that will help do everything in the cloud. 

So, to make sales and get investors, you'll have to understand what customers want. The sooner you figure out customers' needs, the faster you can grow your business. 

## Learn From Failed Businesses  

Connect with other founders and read post-mortems from failed businesses and those who departed the industry. In his [post-mortem diagnosis](https://www.fastcompany.com/40549442/how-shyp-sunk-the-rise-and-fall-of-an-on-demand-startup), co-founder and CEO of Shyp, Kelvin Gibbon, stated that even though their customers and small businesses were enthusiastic about their product, Shyp executives did not focus on building a sustainable business.

The company's profit didn't have the potential to beat the expenditure. Therefore, they lost money with time. Gibbon advises other founders to emphasize building repeatable, scalable, and sustainable business models before they run out of resources.

## Conclusion

If you're serious about venturing into the startup business, then you should be well prepared both psychologically and financially. It's wise to observe and learn from those who succeeded and failed before you to avoid making similar mistakes.
