XPS is a file format developed by Microsoft and ECMA International in 2006. It contains fixed page layout information written in the XPS page description language. XPS documents are similar to PDF but based on XML instead of PostScript. 

You might use XPS files in the Windows Office suite to see what the printed version will look like. Unlike PDFs, you cannot edit an XPS file after you save it, but you can open, view, sign, and manage file permissions in the Microsoft XPS viewer. 

Microsoft introduced the XPS file viewer on Windows Vista and continued to support it on Windows 7, 8.1, and 10. In April 2018, the company discontinued support for the file format and removed the XPS Viewer app from new Windows installations. 

If you're among the many people who still use XPS, and you no longer have access to the application on your PC, there are XPS file viewer tools you can use to get back control over your files. In this article, we look at the 5 best XPS file viewer tools for PC and online use in 2023.

## 3. Windows XPS Viewer

After installing the application on your PC, it should be available in your start menu items. Like most XPS Viewers, Windows XPS Viewer contains options to manage your file. You can view, print, set permissions, and save the document as PDF. 

## 4. Google Drive

If you prefer to perform your activities online. Google Drive allows you to view XPS documents without installing an app on your PC. To start, you must log into your Google account and upload the XPS file on your Google Drive. 

Once you upload the document, you can click to view its contents on the web browser. You can also save the document as PDF on your computer by clicking on the Print icon at the top-right on your window.

## Conclusion

We did not include the Danet studio and XPS Annotator XPS file viewers in the list as they only allow you to view, zoom, and print XPS files. SysTools XPS Viewer has segments that make it difficult to read your document, so we don't recommend it.
