Thanks for visiting my resume website. Read on to learn about my skills and services -- hopefully I'll help you eliminate that initial skeptism :)

Hi there,

I'm Alex Muiruri, a full-stack web developer. I specialize in creating Admin Dashboards and Content Management Systems. Think job boards, eCommerce shops, inventory management applications, and file management systems.

I can work with an agile team to develop a system that meets your requirements or design an entire system from scratch. I'm well-versed in technologies like Laravel, React, NextJS, and Django and can build apps with basic to complex functionalities.

I can also help you build WordPress themes and plugins, craft UX/UI designs using JS and CSS, and create React-Native mobile applications. Contact me at [content@alexmuiruri.com](mailto:content@alexmuiruri.com) for custom web designs.

If you're just scrolling through my website, read some of my articles below and tell me what you think. Your views are important to me.

Kind regards
