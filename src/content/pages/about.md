I'm a software developer with 3 years of experience in web and mobile development. I primarily work with TypeScript and Python, but I'm also proficient in JavaScript, Java, React, NodeJS, and PHP.

I'm passionate about building high-quality and scalable software solutions. In my free time, I enjoy reading and writing about new technologies. 

I'm open to contributing to open-source projects and the community whenever possible. I believe in collaboration and the power of teamwork.
