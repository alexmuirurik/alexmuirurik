I'm Alex Muiruri, a seasoned software engineer with a focus on mobile, web, and backend development. I primarily work with TypeScript, but I'm currently expanding skill-set by learning Rust and Go.

I specialize in building robust systems â€” from admin dashboards and content management platforms to eCommerce applications, inventory systems, and custom mobile apps that solve real business problems.

Do you need a React Native mobile app, custom WordPress plugin, or a clean, functional UI/UX design? Whether it's collaborating with an agile team or architecting a solution from scratch, I've got you covered.

Kind regards,\
Alex
