I'm a software developer with 3 years of programming experience. I primarily work with TypeScript and React, but I'm also proficient in Python, JavaScript, and PHP.

In my free time, I enjoy reading and writing about new technologies, but for now, I'm focused on building high-quality and scallable web and mobile applications.

I'm open to contributing to open-source projects and the community, and I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork.

If you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out to me.
