I'm Alex Muiruri, a software developer with 3 years of experience in web and mobile development. I primarily work with TypeScript, but I'm always eager to improve my skills and learn new technologies.

I'm passionate about building high-quality and scalable software solutions, and I'm open to contributing to open-source projects and the community whenever possible.

In my free time, I enjoy reading and writing about new technologies. If you're interested in my work, please feel free to reach out.

Kind regards,\
Alex
