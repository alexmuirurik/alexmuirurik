Wondering how to get started? Here's a simple breakdown of the onboarding process:

## Discovery Call

Send me an email at [content@alexmuiruri.com](mailto:content@alexmuiruri.com) with your project details, requirements, or to request a paid test project. This helps us align on your needs right from the start. After your initial inquiry, we'll schedule a call to discuss your project in detail. This is your opportunity to share your vision and for me to ask questions that will help clarify the scope of work.

## Proposal & Agreement

Based on our conversation, I'll provide a tailored proposal outlining the project scope, timeline, and budget. Once we agree on the terms, we'll formalize our partnership with a signed contract. We'll hold a kickoff meeting to establish communication channels, project milestones, and any tools we'll use throughout our collaboration.

## Development Phase

I'll start working on your project, providing regular updates and seeking your feedback to ensure we stay aligned with your goals. Before launch, I'll conduct thorough testing to ensure everything works perfectly. We'll launch your project and monitor it closely to address any immediate needs.

Looking forward to working together!
